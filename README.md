**syncbin** is a collection of command-line tools by [Fenhl][], mainly for personal use.

Installation
============

The following *should* install `syncbin`, [`lns`][lns], and [`oh-my-zsh`][]:

```sh
wget -O - https://raw.github.com/fenhl/syncbin/master/config/install.sh | sh
```

From my experience, it's almost guaranteed to not work though.
